Execute the **run.sh** file to generate inputsu for SVM model training. 
  
That file is a wrapper for the following steps: 
  
task=$1  # Name of the task being performed, generated by the user.     
idr=$2  # NarrowPeak file with IDR peak calls.   
fasta=$3 # fasta file for your organism, i.e. /mnt/data/mm10_no_alt_analysis_set_ENCODE.fasta.   
chrom_sizes=$4 #chrom sizes file for your organism, i.e. /mnt/data/annotations/by_release/mm10/mm10.chrom.sizes.   
genomewide_gc_prefix=$5 #you pick this, example genomewide gc files are in /mnt/data/annotations/gc_content_tracks/non_smoothed/.   
  
  
echo "starting $task $idr"     
./get_svm_peak_splits.sh $task $idr    
echo "got svm peak splits"     

./get_gc_positives.sh $task     
echo "got gc content of the positive sequences"     
  
#You want to have gc content bins for your genome of interest for the next step. For human, these can be found in the lab cluster:  
#/mnt/data/annotations/gc_content_tracks/non_smoothed. 
#you can also generate them with this script:    
./get_genomewide_gc_bins.sh $fasta $chrom_sizes $genomewide_gc_prefix. 
  
./get_all_negatives.sh $task $idr  $genomewide_gc_prefix.tsv. 
echo "got candidate negative set"     
  
./get_chrom_gc_region_dict.sh $task    
echo "created python pickle for candidate negatives"     
  
./form_svm_input_fastas.sh $task    
echo "finished creating SVM inputs"
